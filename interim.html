				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<summary> <p class="major"> Norm and Corlynn Christofferson have been in pastoral ministry for over 40 years. They have served in a number of ministry capacities and have experienced both the joys and challenges of ministry life
					facing their own crisis point in ministry, God has brought them to a place of healing and restoration. For a number of years they have carried a burden for leaders who are needing 
					encouragement, and they have stepped alongside several leaders to strengthen and encourage them. With pastoral hearts they will be serving as Barnabas did in encouraging and inspiring leaders to dream again.  
					Along with Leader to leader Norm and Corlynn are busy as interim pasotors. Traveling accorss montana to come along churches who are looking for a new pastor. 

					<h2>Interim Pastoring</h2>
				<p class="major"> As they've been reaching out to leaders some unique doors have been opening, and an
					area of ministry they have been very involved with the last few years is interim pastoring.
					When a pastor moves on from a church after serving for some time it can be a difficult season for a
					congregation to walk through. Several churches that are going through pastoral transition
					have had them come and serve as pastors, leading and guiding the church until a new pastor arrives.
					This ministry has become a significant part of Leader to Leader Ministires. </p>
					<p class="major">Will you join us as we reach out to encourage and bless pastors and other christian leaders?
						We ask you to commit to praying for your own pastor on a regular basis.
