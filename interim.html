				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<summary>
					<p class="major"> Norm and Corlynn Christofferson have been in pastoral ministry for over 40 years.
						They have served in a number of ministry capacities and have experienced both the joys and
						challenges of ministry life.
						Facing their own crisis point in ministry, God has brought them to a place of healing and
						restoration. For a number of years they have carried a burden for leaders who are needing
						encouragement, and they have stepped alongside several leaders to strengthen and encourage them.
						With pastoral hearts they are serving as Barnabas did in encouraging and inspiring leaders
						to dream again.
						Along with Leader to Leader, Norm and Corlynn are busy as interim pasotors, traveling across
						Montana to come alongside churches who are looking for a new pastor.

					<h2>Interim Pastoring</h2>
					<p class="major"> As they've been reaching out to leaders, unique doors have been opening. Interim
						pastoring is one of those areas.
						When a pastor moves on from a church after serving for some time, it can be a difficult season
						for a
						congregation to walk through. Several churches that are going through pastoral transition
						have had them come and serve as pastors, leading and guiding the church until a new pastor
						arrives.
						This ministry has become a significant part of Leader to Leader Ministries. </p>

					<p class="major" style="font-style:italic;">"Join us as we reach out to encourage and bless pastors
						and other Christian leaders.
						We ask you to commit to praying for your own pastor on a regular basis." <br />
						<br />
						-Pastor Norm & Corlynn-
