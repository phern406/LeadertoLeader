						discouragement, financial challenges,
						marital issues,

				<h2>Vision</h2>
				<p class="major"> Leader to Leader Is called to: </p>


				<span style="font-weight:bolder;">Encourage</span> - There is a spiritual "weight" in Christian
				leadership that only other ministry leaders understand.
				Having carried our own weight, we are able to walk with others and encourage them. <span
					style="font-style:italic;"> "Therefore encourage one another and build
					each other up, just as in fact you are doing." 1 Thess 5:11 </span>
				<br>
				<br>

				<span style="font-weight:bolder;">Inspire </span> - Busy leaders sometimes lose the inspiration they
				began ministry with, especially as they deal with the day-to-day
				challenges. Our hope is to inspire and reawaken the unique calling God has placed on their lives.<span
					style="font-style:italic;"> "Think of ways to motivate one another to outbursts of love and good
					deeds." Heb 10:24</span>
				<br>
				<br>

				<span style="font-weight:bolder;">Dream </span> - Every leader has carried dreams in their hearts that
				have been placed there by God. Our goal is to see big dreams
				become reality as we dream together. <span style="font-style:italic;">"When dreams come true, there is
					life and joy." Prov 13:12b</span> </p>

				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<summary>
					<p class="major"> Norm and Corlynn Christofferson have been in pastoral ministry for over 40 years.
						They have served in a number of ministry capacities and have experienced both the joys and
						challenges of ministry life.
						Facing their own crisis point in ministry, God has brought them to a place of healing and
						restoration. For a number of years they have carried a burden for leaders who are needing
						encouragement, and they have stepped alongside several leaders to strengthen and encourage them.
						With pastoral hearts they are serving as Barnabas did in encouraging and inspiring leaders
						to dream again.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Along with Leader to Leader, Norm and Corlynn are busy as interim pastors, traveling across
						Montana to come alongside churches who are looking for a new pastor. <span><a

						<h3>Mike Manuel</h3>
						<h4> Lead Pastor - NewLife Church in Farifield, MT</h4>
						<p style="font-style:italic;">"Norm and Corlynn Christofferson and Leader to Leader Ministires
							have been a great blessing to me and the church that I lead. They're always there to
							encourage us and
							lift us up in prayer. Recently a couple on our leadership team was experiencing problems,
							and the Christoffersons were there right away to provide counseling and prayer
							to the couple, as well as encouragement to others on our team. Not only do they love and
							support those they minister to, they know how to do it in a very effective way.
							Because of their fruitful ministry, our church has made the decision to financially support
							the Christoffersons on a monthly basis, and we encourage you to do that as well
							so that they can continue to uphold the body of Christ through Leader to Leader Ministries."

						<h3>Terry Tyler </h3>
						<h4>Board Chairman - Chester Assembly of God in Chester, MT</h4>
						<p style="font-style:italic;"> "During our pastoral transition, Pastor Norm and Corlynn brought
							spiritual leadership to our congregation with anointed preaching, teaching, worship, and a
							genuine love
							for people. The Christoffersons didn't just fill the pulpit, they helped us through a
							difficult time with their wisdom and mentoring our leaders
							through the Word and by example."</p>

						<h3>Duane Weinmeister</h3>
						<h4>Lead Pastor - First Assembly of God in Boulder, MT</h4>
						<p style="font-style:italic;"> "Leader To Leader Ministries has been a great encouragement. Not
							only do they help in walking through the good times and the bad times of ministry, there is
							also
							encouragement to know Jesus more intimately so that our spiritual walk is more fulfilling. A
							great resource to 'stay in the game' and do well!"</p>

						<h3>Kati Maricle </h3>
						<h4>Associate Pastor - New Life Community Church in Shelby, MT</h4>
						<p style="font-style:italic;">

							"Leader to Leader Ministries has blessed me and the church I serve tremendously. Personally,
							Norm and Corlynn have been leaders who have walked miles ahead
							of me and have encouraged and discipled with truth and love. Our church was experiencing a
							difficult transition, and their ministry helped us heal and grow. While
							Norm served as our interim pastor, we were loved on, strengthened, and built up. What a
							blessing they both are through the wisdom they've acquired and attentiveness to the Holy
							Spirit.
							I am incredibly grateful to know them, and I know many others would agree."
